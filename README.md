# ATM MACHINE
The diagram shows interactions between different actors — Actor1 (Customer), Technician, Bank Admin, and the Bank System — with various ATM functionalities. The Customer can perform actions such as Enter Card, Enter PIN, Authentication, and Perform Transaction, which includes options like Cash Withdrawal, Transfer Funds, Check Balance, and Deposit. The Print Receipt use case extends from the Perform Transaction process. The Authentication process includes interaction with a Validator to verify the user. The Bank System actor is responsible for Authorizing Transactions and Updating Balances after successful operations. The Technician performs tasks such as Refilling Cash and Maintaining the ATM Machine, ensuring it operates properly. The Bank Admin oversees higher-level operations, including Generating Reports and Monitoring Transactions. Overall, this diagram effectively illustrates the functional relationships and dependencies among different components involved in an ATM system.
